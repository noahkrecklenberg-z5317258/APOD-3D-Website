        <h3>What is a Cluster of Galaxies?</h3>
        <p>
          A galaxy cluster is a large family of galaxies that are bound together by gravity, and contain enough matter to pull galaxies together.
        </p>

        <h3>Where is the Fornax Cluster of Galaxies?</h3>
        <p>
          The Fornax Cluster of Galaxies is located over 60 million light-years away from Earth, a relatively close neighbour to the Milky Way.
        </p>

        <h2>Orbiting the Cluster of Galaxies</h2>
        
        <h3>A Cluster of Galaxies composition</h3>
        <p>
         A Cluster of Galaxies mass is normally made up of approximately 80% dark matter, 15% hot plasma, and only 5% galaxies. 
        </p>

        <h3>What's inside the Fornax Cluster of Galaxies</h3>
        <p>
         The cluster contains around a dozen large galaxies and hundreds of smaller ones. 
         The cluster's centre is dominated by an elliptical galaxy known as NGC 1399, which consists exclusively of old stars. 
         The bottom right of the cluster's mosiac contains the famous NGC 1365, a giant barred spiral galaxy.

        <h2>Journey through to the Cluster's Centre</h2>
        <h3>elliptical Galaxies</h3>
        <p>
          elliptical galaxies have an ellipisodal and even shape. They are comprised of a central bulge, no prominent disk and no spiral arms, and contain older and redder stars. 
        </p>
        <h3>Spiral Galaxies</h3>
        <p>
          Spiral galaxies are made up of 3 visible parts: a rotating disk composed of stars, gas, and dust in the form of spiral arms; a central bulge of older stars; a spherical halo of the oldest stars and globular star clusters.
        </p>
        <h3>Lenticular Galaxies</h3>
        <p>
          A lenticular galaxy has a spiral shape but lacks the prominence of spiral arms.
        </p>
        <h3>Irregular Galaxies</h3>
        <p>
         An irreglar galaxy lacks a distinct or regular shape, and often appear to be chaotic. 
        </p>

        <h2>The Journey towards the unknown</h2>
        <h3>Hubble's Classification Scheme</h3>
        <p>
          Elliptical galaxies are classified as E and 0-7 (dependent the galaxies spherical nature). S0 is a lenticular galaxy. Spiral galaxies are split into S and SB (barred) and then a-c (depedent on the bulge's size and dust amount).
        </p>
        <h3>Irregular Galaxy Types</h3>
        <p>
         Type I galaxies resemble a disconnected galaxy puzzle piece, and contain features similar to those defined in Hubble's Classification Scheme. Type II and dward galaxies are chaotic by nature, and lacks any sort of resemblance to Hubble's Classification Scheme.
